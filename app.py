These tumors exhibit variability in their aggressiveness and are categorized based on cell type and brain location. Symptoms associated with gliomas vary but commonly encompass headaches, seizures, and neurological impairments.\n\n Treatment modalities for gliomas hinge on factors such as tumor grade and location, encompassing surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Given their inclination to infiltrate neighboring brain tissue, gliomas pose a significant challenge in treatment. Prognosis is highly variable, influenced by factors such as tumor type and stage, contributing to a diverse range of outcomes.")

These tumors are usually benign (non-cancerous) and slow-growing, often causing no symptoms. However, if they grow large enough or press on nearby structures, they can lead to symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and changes in vision or personality.  \n\n  Treatment options include observation, surgery, radiation therapy, and in some cases, medication. The prognosis for meningioma is generally favorable, especially for benign tumors that are completely removed. Regular monitoring is recommended for those with asymptomatic or small tumors.")
